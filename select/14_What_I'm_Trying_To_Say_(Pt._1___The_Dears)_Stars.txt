I am trying to say
What I want to say
Without having to say
What I want to say

You look so good in the clothes of a poser
And when you smile all the kids fell apart here
I know a place where it's warm and it's dry, dear
Let me take you there

North of the river all the streets are the same
We can't pretend that they don't know our name
And the heat is turned all the way full
So don't pretend that you don't feel the pull

You look so good in the shoes of an outcast
I kissed your throat every time you said it wouldn't last
But then I knew you, I knew you, I knew you, I really knew you

We fell apart in the parties of the empty heart
We danced like junkies in the shadows of bad modern art
We clicked our heels and we wished we were home
One more tab and your silk hits the chrome

Spring comes in when I'm rolling up another one
I draw the curtains in the glare of the same old sun
We are collapsed in the act of just being here
Three blues, two greens, and a beer
We are collapsed in the act of just being here
Three blues, two greens, and a beer

I am trying to say
What I want to say
Without having to say
What I want to say

I am trying to say
What I want to say
Without having to say
What I want to say
